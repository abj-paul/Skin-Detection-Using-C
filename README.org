* About
In this project, we train a naive bayes model with masked-unmasked images without using any library function. It only takes ~3.91s~ to train the whole model! While it takes 10~50 min in python implementation.
Then we perform ~Cross Fold Validation~, again without using any library function and notice an average accuracy of 81%.
Our [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAk1F-0Rwo1JZ7DpGB6ZkRrcJesQu-sm/view?usp=sharing][Skin Detection dataset]] has two types of images. The original image is the whole image while the masked image masks the nonskin parts. Thus, a model can learn to differentiate between skin and nonskin.
* Example
We mask nonskin part of an image in this project. For example:
[[file:practice/test-image.png]]
And our masked image becomes:
[[file:practice/masked_image.png]]

* Cross Fold Validation
You can find a [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_jV6dhrsRA0BRcse00s6_0fTw_DAJN_F?usp=sharing][Cloud Instance where the entire process is hosted.]]
Note that, our Confusion Matrix has the following form.
0 = NonSkin
1 = Skin
| Actual | Predicted | Case           |
|--------+-----------+----------------|
|      0 |         0 | False Negative |
|      0 |         1 | False Positive |
|      1 |         0 | True Negative  |
|      1 |         1 | True Positive  |
* How to run it?
Download skin detection dataset from [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAk1F-0Rwo1JZ7DpGB6ZkRrcJesQu-sm/view?usp=sharing][this drive link.]] And put the zip file in the cloned directory.
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/abj-paul/Skin-Detection-Using-C
  unzip ibtd.zip # unzipping the dataset
  morgify -format ppm ibtd/*.jpg # Converting all jpg file to .ppm format
  morgify -format ppm ibtd/Mask/*.bmp
  rm ibtd/*.jpg
  rm ibtd/Mask/*.bmp

  make
  ./a.out
  xdg-open masked_test-image.ppm
  ls
#+end_src
* Jupyter Notebook
There is also a jupyter notebook with its python implementation here. It takes a long time to run though. (~50min)
